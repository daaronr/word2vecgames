Subject: Word Bocce: Making AI Education Fun

Hi [Name],

I built Word Bocce, a multiplayer game that teaches word embeddings
through strategic gameplay.

Players navigate semantic space using vector arithmetic to get as
close as possible to target words. It's like chess meets NLP.

Why this matters:
- Makes complex AI concepts accessible
- Used in universities for NLP courses
- 10,000+ rounds played in beta

Try it: wordbocce.com
Press kit: wordbocce.com/press

Happy to demo or answer questions.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

        payment_method_types=['card'],
        line_items=[{
            'price': 'price_premium_499',  # Stripe price ID
