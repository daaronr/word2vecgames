## After Deployment

### 1. Test Your Deployment

Visit your URL (e.g., `https://wordbocce.up.railway.app`)

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Word Bocce game interface
- ‚úÖ "Quick Play" button works
- ‚úÖ Can create and join matches
- ‚úÖ Shareable links work

### 2. Share Your Game

**Quick Play Flow:**
1. Player 1 clicks "Quick Play"
2. Gets a link: `https://yourapp.com/?match=m_1234567_5678`
3. Shares link with Friend
4. Friend clicks link, enters name, auto-joins

## Customization

### Custom Domain

**Railway:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Add Custom Domain
2. Add CNAME: `wordbocce.com` ‚Üí `yourapp.up.railway.app`

**Render:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Custom Domains ‚Üí Add Domain
2. Add CNAME as instructed

**Result:** `https://wordbocce.com` instead of platform subdomain

### Environment Variables

To change game settings, set these in your platform's dashboard:

```
DECK_SIZE=15000              # More word variety
WILDCARD_RATIO=0.3           # 30% JOKER cards
ROUND_TIMEOUT_SECS=180       # 3-minute rounds
```

**Where to set:**
- Railway: Variables tab
- Render: Environment ‚Üí Add Environment Variable
- Fly.io: `fly secrets set KEY=value`
- Heroku: `heroku config:set KEY=value`

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Railway
- Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Metrics
- See: Requests/sec, CPU, Memory, Build times

### Render
- Your Service ‚Üí Metrics tab
- See: Response times, Memory, CPU

### Google Analytics (Optional)

Add to `index.html` before `</head>`:
```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed

**"Download embeddings failed":**
- Build timeout on free tier
- Solution: Use smaller `glove-100` model (default)
- Already configured in `Dockerfile`

**"Port already in use":**
- Your app isn't using `$PORT` environment variable
- Fixed in our Dockerfile: `--port ${PORT}`

### App Crashes

**Check logs:**
```bash
# Railway: Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
# Render: Service ‚Üí Logs tab
# Fly.io: fly logs
# Heroku: heroku logs --tail
```

**Common issues:**
1. Out of memory: Reduce `DECK_SIZE`
2. Build timeout: Already using fast `glove-100`
3. Port binding: Already fixed in Dockerfile

### Slow Response

**First request slow (30s+):**
- App is "waking up" from sleep (Render, Heroku)
- Solution: Use Railway or Fly.io (no sleep)
- Or: Keep app warm with uptime monitoring

**Always slow:**
- Embeddings not loaded
- Check logs for errors
- Verify `MODEL_PATH` is correct

---

## Scaling Up

When you outgrow free tier:

### Railway: $5/month
- 500 hrs ‚Üí Unlimited
- Shared CPU ‚Üí Dedicated CPU

### Render: $7/month
- No sleep
- More resources

### Fly.io: $5-10/month
- Scale VMs
- More regions

---

## Security Considerations

**Current MVP:**
- No authentication (anyone can create matches)
- No data persistence (matches lost on restart)
- No rate limiting

**For production:**
- Add user accounts (Auth0, Firebase)
- Add Redis for match persistence
- Add rate limiting (FastAPI middleware)
- Add profanity filter for joker cards

See `DEPLOY.md` for production hardening steps.
