2. âœ… Installs Python, nginx, dependencies
3. âœ… Clones your repository
4. âœ… Downloads word embeddings (~330MB)
5. âœ… Creates systemd service (auto-restart)
6. âœ… Configures nginx reverse proxy
7. âœ… Sets up firewall (UFW)
8. âœ… Starts the application

**Check if running:**
```bash
systemctl status wordbocce
```

**View logs:**
```bash
journalctl -u wordbocce -f
```

**Restart service:**
```bash
systemctl restart wordbocce
```

**Update to latest code:**
```bash
cd /opt/word2vecgames
git pull
systemctl restart wordbocce
```

**Stop service:**
```bash
systemctl stop wordbocce
```

## Adding a Domain (Optional)

If you have a domain like `wordbocce.com`:

1. **Point DNS to your Linode:**
   - A record: `@` â†’ `45.79.160.157`
   - A record: `www` â†’ `45.79.160.157`

2. **Update nginx config:**
   ```bash
   nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordbocce
   ```

   Change:
   ```nginx
   server_name 45.79.160.157;
   ```

   To:
   ```nginx
   server_name wordbocce.com www.wordbocce.com;
   ```

3. **Add SSL (HTTPS):**
   ```bash
   certbot --nginx -d wordbocce.com -d www.wordbocce.com
   ```

4. **Restart nginx:**
   ```bash
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't connect to server:**
```bash
# Check if service is running
systemctl status wordbocce

# Check logs for errors
journalctl -u wordbocce -n 50
```

**Port 80 blocked:**
```bash
# Check firewall
ufw status

# Allow HTTP
ufw allow 80/tcp
```

**Out of memory:**
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h

# May need to upgrade Linode to 2GB plan
```

**Need to restart:**
```bash
systemctl restart wordbocce
systemctl restart nginx
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Test the game at http://45.79.160.157
2. âœ… Share the presentation: http://45.79.160.157/presentation.html
3. âœ… Add a custom domain (optional)
4. âœ… Add SSL/HTTPS (optional but recommended)
5. âœ… Share with friends and get feedback!

## Cost

If using a dedicated Linode:
- **Nanode 1GB:** $5/month (adequate for testing)
- **Linode 2GB:** $10/month (better for production)

If adding to existing Linode: **$0** (already paying for it!)

## Security Notes

- The deployment script sets up a basic firewall (UFW)
- Only ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) are open
- Consider adding fail2ban for SSH protection
- Add HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (free SSL)

**Add fail2ban (optional):**
```bash
apt install fail2ban -y
systemctl enable fail2ban
systemctl start fail2ban
```

## Support

- **Full guide:** See `LINODE_DEPLOY.md` for detailed instructions
- **Logs location:** `/var/log/nginx/` and `journalctl -u wordbocce`
- **App location:** `/opt/word2vecgames/`

Good luck with your deployment! ðŸŽ‰
