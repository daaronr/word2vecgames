## First Game Tutorial

1. **Create a Match**
   - Enter your name
   - Click "Create New Match"
   - Share the Match ID with friends (or play solo for testing)

2. **Start Round**
   - Click "Start Game"
   - You'll see:
     - Starting word (e.g., "apple")
     - Target word (e.g., "cider")
     - 10 public cards everyone can see
     - 2 private cards only you see

3. **Make Your Move**
   - Pick one public card (click + or -)
   - Pick one private card (click + or -)
   - Click "Submit Move"

4. **See Results**
   - Click "View Results" to see the leaderboard
   - Highest cosine similarity wins!
   - See what word your vector landed on

5. **Next Round**
   - Click "Next Round" to play again

## Pro Tips

- **Think semantically**: If target is "cider", words like "ferment", "juice", "apple" point in the right direction
- **Use subtraction**: Sometimes you need to move *away* from concepts
- **JOKER cards**: If you get a üÉè, you can type ANY word!
- **Nearest word**: Shows what actual word your vector is closest to - helps you understand the space

---

## Troubleshooting

**Can't connect?**
- Make sure both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 8080) are running

**"Token not in vocabulary"?**
- Try a simpler word, or use the google-news model which has more words

**Too slow?**
- Set `export USE_ANNOY=1` before starting backend
- Or reduce deck size: `export DECK_SIZE=50000`
